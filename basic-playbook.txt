Ansible playbooks are written in YAML.

Important concepts

1. Start of file 

--- 

Three dashes to indicate the beginning of the playbook.if you forget to put those three dashes at the top of your playbook, Ansible won't complain.

2. comments

# This is a yaml comments

3. stings

you can quote them if you prefer.

'this is sentence'

4. Booleans

Why do you use true in one place and yes in another?

True and false values in playbooks, module argments(for example, udate_cache=yes)
Are treated differently from value elsewhere in playbook ( for example sudo: true)

5. lists

YAML lists are like arrays in python also called sequences in YAML.

 - mMy Lady
 - Ok
 - Pirate
 
6. Dictionaries

These are called mappings in YAML

city: banglore

7. Line folding
