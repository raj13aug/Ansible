Here we will install Ansible on Ubuntu 18.04 system directly from the Ansible's git repository. The advantage of this installation is that it will yield the highest Ansible version possible

perform the installation of all prerequisites:

$ sudo apt install make git make python-setuptools gcc python-dev libffi-dev libssl-dev python-packaging

Next, download Ansible source code using the git command:
$ git clone git://github.com/ansible/ansible.git

Navigate to the ansible directory:
$ cd ansible

This step is optional as it only allows you to select the desired Ansible version to be installed on your system. The following linux command will list all available Ansible versions:
$  git branch -a
